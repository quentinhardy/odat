ODAT 
====

__ODAT__ (Oracle Database Attacking Tool) is an open source __penetration testing__ tool that tests the security of __Oracle Databases remotely__.

Usage examples of ODAT:
* You have an Oracle database listening remotely and want to find valid __SIDs__ and __credentials__ in order to connect to the database
* You have a valid Oracle account on a database and want to __escalate your privileges__ to become DBA or SYSDBA
* You have a Oracle account and you want to __execute system commands__ (e.g. __reverse shell__) in order to move forward on the operating system hosting the database

Tested on Oracle Database __10g__,  __11g__,  __12c__, __18c__ and __19c__.

__ODAT linux standalone__ version at [https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat/releases/](https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat/releases/). Notice it is recommended to use the development version  (*git clone*), *master-python3* branch (python 3 version).

Changelog
====
* Version __5.1.1__ (__27/04/2022__):
  * print a warning message when an "ORA-12519 - TNS:no appropriate service handler found" occured. This error can be triggered by the database server (listener) when too many connections have been established (when bruteforcing credentials for example). In this case, __--sleep__ option should be used (e.g. *--sleep 0.2*).
* Version __5.1__ (__12/03/2021__):
  * new option in _all_ module: __--nmap-file__ for loading all Oracle databases from a nmap XML outpout file
  * new option in _all_ module: __-l__ for loading all targets from a text file (ip:port or ip on each line) 
  * In _all_ module, a TCP connection is tested on each target before to start ODAT tests now. __--timeout-tcp-check__ can be used to manage timeout value.
  * In _all_ module, a test is done on each target now for checking if the TNS listener is well configured. This test is done after TCP connection test.
  * new global option: __--client-driver__. Allows to set the client name for database connection (__client_driver__ from __V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO__). 
    Useful for applications whose end-users are not aware cx_Oracle is being. used. By default, 'sql*plus' now.
  * ODAT accepts a __sqlnet.ora__ file now. A default file is in __conf/__. The timeout TCP & OUTBOUND (TNS) connection is set to 60 seconds by default now.  
* Version __5.0__ (__08/02/2021__):
  * Important new module: __Service Name Guesser__, for searching valid Service Names. Specific module named __*snguesser*__ and integrated in *all* module too. By default, *all* module searches all valid Service Names now after searching SIDs. SIDs can be identical to Service Name. When a Service Name is found but not a SID, Service Name can be used as a SID for connection.
  * __--basic-info__ option in _search_ module for getting some basic technical information about the database/instance. It gets Service Name, SID, databases, Oracle Database Vault status, Java status, hostname, ip address of the server, password policy, current system pivileges, current roles, pathches (when >= 12c and user is privileged), etc. Requires high pivileges for very interesting information (e.g. password policy & lock status).
  * Reverse shell implemented in _DbmsScheduler_ module when the target is Windows. Starts a minimal http server, makes the Oracle Database download the powershell code and executes it remotely. The user has an interactive PS shell. Downloaded file is removed automatically.
  * _--make-download_ option implemented in _DbmsScheduler_ in order to make download a Windows target a script/binary file.
  * Bug fix in output in _DbmsScheduler_ module (_printOSCmdOutput()_).
  * Better explanations in _DbmsScheduler_ module (options).
* Version __4.3__ (__28/06/2020__):
  * new option: _--both-ul_. Try each password in lower case and upper case if it is not done in credential file(s)
  * new option: _--random-order_. Test accounts in random order. By default, it uses the text file order
  * all passwords are tested in lower case now by default (account files modified from upper to lower case)
  * some new accounts
* Version __4.2__ (__04/02/2020__):
  * minimal interactive SQL shell in search module
  * new feature for downloading files with DBMS_XSLPROCESSOR.read2clob in DbmsXslprocessor module
  * improvement for having remote OS after authentication
  * bug fix (e.g. terminal size)
* Version __4.1__ (__01/15/2020__):
  * Option for connection with SERVICE NAME instead of SID
  * Encoding set to UTF-8 by default for some operations (e.g. NVARCHAR2 and NCLOB, VARCHAR2 and CLOB)
  * Multiple bug fixes (encoding problems)
* Version __4.0__ (__08/10/2019__):
  * Odat with python 3, stable version
* Version __3.0__ (__01/09/2019__):
  * Compatible with Oracle Database 18c
  * New option in Java module for setting the path to shell (e.g. /usr/bin/sh when CentOS)
* Version __2.3.2__ (__16/07/2019__):
  * Bug fixes:
    * external table and false negative
* Version __2.3.1__ (__10/08/2018__):
  * New option in Java module for exploiting CVE-2018-3004: It allows an authenticated user to arbitrarily write to files on the OS (Privilege escalation with bypass built in Oracle JVM security). More details [http://obtruse.syfrtext.com/2018/07/oracle-privilege-escalation-via.html](http://obtruse.syfrtext.com/2018/07/oracle-privilege-escalation-via.html). 
* Version __2.3__ (__06/03/2018__):
  * Bug fixes:
    * Some database credentials could not be detected in passwordguesser module (when it tries to connect as SYSDBA/SYSOPER before). Important bug fix!
    * PPoutput missing in smb module (thx to dirkjanm)
    * False positive in tnspoison module
    * Sometimes, impossible to get version from VSNNUM
  * Improvements:
    * Performence improvements when you bruteforce accounts.
    * Option for connection with a TNS Connection String
    * New trivial credentials in accounts file
    * Better read file method in dbmsLob module (thx to omair2084)
* Version __2.2.1__ (__12/04/2017__):
  * Bug fixes: 
    * Version in tnscmd ([info](https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat/commit/9b7ec57cfed0fe74381edff28b73532562acaa2c))
    * External module (Catch an Oracle error)

  * new option (__--accounts-files__) for remote authentication attack which uses 2 distinct files: a login list and password list.
  * Print 10g passwords for oclHashcat compatibility.
  * bug fixes (listening with __nc__).
* Version __2.0__ (__21/02/2016__) :
  * A new module (_privesc_) for using system privileges of an Oracle user (e.g. CREATE ANY PROCEDURE) in order to gain privileged access (i.e. DBA). System privileges that can be used by ODAT in this version:
    * CREATE ANY PROCEDURE: execution of arbitrary requests with APEX_040200's privileges (e.g. modification of Oracle users' passwords)
    * CREATE PROCEDURE and EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE: execution of arbitrary requests as SYS (e.g. gives DBA role to a user)
    * CREATE ANY TRIGER (and CREATE PROCEDURE): execution of arbitrary requests as SYS (e.g. gives DBA role to a user)

Supported Platforms and dependencies
====

ODAT is compatible with __Linux__ only.

__Standalone version__ exists in order to don't have need to install dependencies (see [https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat/releases/](https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat/releases/)).
The ODAT standalone has been generated thanks to *pyinstaller*.

If you want to have the __development version__ installed on your computer, these following tools and dependencies are needed:
* Langage: Python 3
* Oracle dependancies: 
  * Instant Oracle basic
  * Instant Oracle sdk
* Python libraries: 
  * cx_Oracle
  * passlib
  * pycrypto
  * python-scapy
  * python-libnmap (new from python 5.1)    
  * colorlog (recommended)
  * termcolor (recommended)
  * argcomplete (recommended)
  * pyinstaller (recommended)

Installation (optional, for development version)
====

This part describes how to install instantclient, CX_Oracle and some others python libraries on __Ubuntu__ in order to have the ODAT development version. 
Don't forget that an ODAT standalone version exists at [https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat/releases/](https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat/releases/): __It is not required to install something for use the standalone version__

* Clone the repository to get the ODAT source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat.git
```

* Update wiki pages in this repository for getting the ODAT documentation locally:
```bash
cd odat/
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

* Get instant client basic, sdk (devel) and sqlplus from the Oracle web site:
  * X64: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html
  * X86: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxsoft-082809.html
  
* For the moment (03/2021), Oracle Database instant client version 11.2 is the best version if you want to generate the ODAT standalone with pyinstaller.
For using the ODAT development version, the last version of the Oracle client can be used (e.g. version 19).

* Install *python3-dev*, *alien* and *libaio1* package (for sqlplus):
```bash
sudo apt-get install libaio1 python3-dev alien python3-pip

# adding python dependencies
pip install pycryptodome python-libnmap
```

* Generate DEB files from RPM files with :
```bash
sudo alien --to-deb oracle-instantclient19.3-basic-???.x???.rpm
sudo alien --to-deb oracle-instantclient19.3-devel-???.x???.rpm
```

* Install instant client basic, sdk and sqlplus:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i oracle-instantclient19.3-basic-???.x???.deb
sudo dpkg -i oracle-instantclient19.3-devel_???_???.deb
```

* Put these lines in your */etc/profile* file in order to define Oracle *env* variables:
```bash
export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/19.3/client64/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib
export PATH=${ORACLE_HOME}bin:$PATH
```

* Restart your session (to apply env variables)

* Create the */etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle.conf* file and add the path to Oracle home:
```
/usr/lib/oracle/19.3/client64/lib/
```

* Update the ldpath using:
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```

* Install *CX_Oracle*
```bash
sudo -s
source /etc/profile
pip3 install cx_Oracle
```

* Test if all is good:
```bash
python3 -c 'import cx_Oracle' 
```
> This command should *just return* without errors.

* Install some python libraries:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-scapy
sudo pip3 install colorlog termcolor pycrypto passlib python-libnmap
sudo pip3 install argcomplete && sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete
```

* Download and install the __development__ version of pyinstaller (http://www.pyinstaller.org/) for python 3.
```bash
python setup.py install
```

* or install through pip:
```bash
pip3 install pyinstaller
```

* Run ODAT:
```bash
./odat.py -h
```

> __Good job if you have not errors:)__
